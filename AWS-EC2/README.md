# What is AWS EC2

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. With EC2, you can launch virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage. 

## Different Types of AWS EC2

AWS EC2 instances are categorized into different types based on their use cases. Here are the main categories:

### 1. General Purpose
- **Use Case**: Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
- **Examples**: T4g, M6g, M5, A1.
- **Best For**: Web servers, development environments, and small databases.

### 2. Compute Optimized
- **Use Case**: High-performance processors for compute-intensive tasks.
- **Examples**: C6g, C5, C4.
- **Best For**: High-performance web servers, scientific modeling, and batch processing.

### 3. Memory Optimized
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring high memory.
- **Examples**: R6g, R5, X1e, X1.
- **Best For**: In-memory databases, real-time big data analytics.

### 4. Storage Optimized
- **Use Case**: High, sequential read and write access to large datasets.
- **Examples**: I3, D2, H1.
- **Best For**: Data warehousing, distributed file systems.

### 5. GPU Instances
- **Use Case**: Accelerated computing for graphics and machine learning.
- **Examples**: P4, G4, G3.
- **Best For**: Machine learning, gaming, and video rendering.

### 6. High Performance Computing (HPC)
- **Use Case**: Applications requiring high throughput and low latency.
- **Examples**: Hpc6a.
- **Best For**: Scientific simulations, financial modeling.

Each instance type is designed to optimize performance for specific workloads, allowing you to choose the best fit for your application.
